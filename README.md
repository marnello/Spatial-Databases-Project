I chose to do a study of air and noise pollution in Ireland, and how it specifically relates to the location of primary and post primary schools. The reason behind this is that I went to primary school in Kill, Co. Kildare - most people are familiar with it from driving past on the busy N7. When I was in school, the road was a significantly quieter dual carriage way, however it has now expanded to a six-lane road that is more equivalent to a motorway. In this study, I looked at the location of schools relative to main roads, traffic lights, main rail lines, as well as looking at specific studies on noise pollution and air pollution.
